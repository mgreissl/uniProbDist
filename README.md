# List of univariate probability distributions

This list gives an overview of the most popular univariate probability distributions and their most important properties.
You can download the PDF [here](https://github.com/mgreissl/uniProbDist/raw/main/univariateProbabilityDistributions.pdf).

I created this list in winter semester 2020/21 to accompany the lecture Introduction to Probability and Statistics. It served to learn how to create plots of different distributions with ggplot2 in R and to learn a little bit of TeX.
